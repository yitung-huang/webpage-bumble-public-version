# A Proposal Bumble Profile

Since we met each other on Bumble, I've created a web page that closely resembles Bumble
to propose to my girlfriend (with a twist!). However, I'm a little shy with making all
of this public, so I've regenerated all of our couple photos with ChatGPT and replaced
them all. The contents have all been replaced by Lorem Ipsum texts as well.

You can check out the Bumble profile [here](https://proposal.thetomputer.com).

## Technical details

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

After you've clone this repo, you'll be able to run the development server locally using `npm run dev` after installing all the packages. You'll be able to see the Bumble profile in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Feel free to edit the content as you like and host it for your own use.
